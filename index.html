									<a href="https://github.com/EWiliams0590/Spotify" class="image fit"><img src="images/music_picture.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project takes my streaming data from Spotify and creates a recommended playlist using a K-Means clustering model. 
										For reproducibility purposes, most of the files in the repository are .py files.</p>

									<p>
										This project was made to analyze many different stock tickers and discover attributes that beat the market. Two custom attributes beat
										the overall market by 60%. For reproducibility purposes, most of the files in the repository are .py files.

									<p>
										Using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club">Lending Club dataset</a>, I wanted to create a model to better predict whether a loan would
										be fully paid or charged off. I did preliminary cleaning and feature engineering in SQL, then explored, visualized, and created a predictive model using Python (Jupyter Notebook).
										The results showed that one of the engineered features (Zip-code, from address) greatly increased the predictive accuracy (~89% vs ~80% baseline). Both a neural network
										using Tensorflow/Keras and XGBoostClassifier were used, and performed almost exactly the same, so I kept the XGBoost model as the final due to interpretability.

									<p>
										Using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting">Superstore Sales data</a>, which is sales from a store containing categories Office Supplies,
										Technology, and Furniture. I noticed that the average sales per order varied a lot with the three categories, so decided to focus on forecasting only the Furniture
										category. Digging into this, there were four subcategories, one of which (Furnishings) had a very low average sale per order vs. others, so I split this into two
										datasets from here, "Furnishings" and "Non-Furnishings". I then explored the data further and use Prophet to forecast individually on the Furnishings and Non-Furnishings
										data. Despite highly irregular data with too much noise, the model was able to have the mean absolute percentage error on the two for daily predictions to be 89% and 54%,
										respectively.

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/EWiliams0590/AbaloneRegression/blob/main/Abalone.ipynb" class="image fit"><img src="images/abalone.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This is a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and creating a regularized linear regression model to predict the age of an abalone using Python. I made use of
										many of the standard Data Science libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Sci-Kit Learn. The regression model performed very
										well on dataset with less than 14 rings (RMSE ~1.5), which is the majority of the data. There was an RMSE of ~4.5 for the abalone with at 
										least 14 rings.

									<a href="https://github.com/EWiliams0590/BodyFat_Prediction/blob/main/Bodyfat%20Prediction.ipynb" class="image fit"><img src="images/bodyfat.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This project was focused on predicting bodyfat percentages based on measurements. It is very hard to get an accurate prediction with the
										naked eye. Cheap methods (using calipers) are very unreliable and accurate methods are very expensive. By perform extensive feature
										selection and model selection, an ElasticNet model yielded the best and simplest results, which had a mean absolute error of ~3.5%.

									<a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ethan.williams/viz/AdventureWorksSalesAnalysis/FinalSalesDashboard" class="image fit"><img src="images/bicycles.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This project was done using the database AdventureWorks2019 provided by Microsoft. I used SQL Server to create a complex query involving
										joins, window functions, user created functions, and stored procedures to get a final view, then analyzed the sales data to see what drove
										an increase in sales over time. As discovered, the promotion done on the new touring bikes worked quite well.

									<p>
										I wanted to better understand and visualize how the main data being tracked on COVID would change over time. I found some data by web-scraping
										and searching for datasets, aggregated created views in SQL Server, then used them in Tableau to visualize cases, deaths, and vaccinations
										changing over time and how they are related.
